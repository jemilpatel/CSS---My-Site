        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p class="description">I bet you cannot beat me at any game once I get a grip over it. Gaming will always remain a part of my life. From my childhood, I am fantasized by gaming and always dream about completing difficult levels or maybe to be the best among all. My most favorite game till date I have played is PUBG Mobile. PUBG is not just a game, it's an emotion! Sorry for speaking much, now let's look below for my other skills.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p class="description">I just love programming. The fact of getting useful and amazing outputs by just writing some code excites me the most. The first programming language which I learnt in my school was Java. I thought Java was the most efficient and best language until I discovered Python. Python is a much more dynamic language with greater flexibility. Right now I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a part of my web development course so I have created this site.</p>
